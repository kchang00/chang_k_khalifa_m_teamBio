JS Logic:

1. Show only one team member's information (picture, heading, and populate the <p> tag with content from the array)
2. On click of other team member's small picture, check which team member's info is displayed and:
	a. swap the source of the current large picture and replace it with the other large picture
	b. swap the source of the current small picture and replace it with the other small picture
	c. replace the written content with new content (change to other item in array)
		i. includes heading tags and p tags
