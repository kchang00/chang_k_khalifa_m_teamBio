JS Logic:

1. Show only one team member's information (picture, heading, and <p> tag populated with an array)
2. On click of other team member's small picture:
	a. Swap the source of first large picture and replace it with second large picture
	b. Swap the source of the first small picture and replace it with the second small picture
	c. Replace the written content with new content (change arrays)
		i. includes heading tags and p tags
