				<p class="Mariam-p column">Kayla Chang is currently an Interactive Media Design student at Fanshawe College, where she strives to become a versatile artist by creating websites, games, photography, print and animation, among other forms of digital media.</p>
				<p class="Mariam-p column">Kayla enjoys creating intuitive design that exudes personality, while staying authentic to brand vision. She is passionate about storytelling and visual narratives that impact others in meaningful ways, from creative arts pieces to applications that enhance the user experience with functional, accessible, and striking design.</p>
				<p class="Mariam-p column">She is probably working away at a project right now at her home based in London, Ontario. Most likely with a huge mug of tea as her only company, she would appreciate if you contacted her at k_chang@fanshaweonline.ca.</p>
